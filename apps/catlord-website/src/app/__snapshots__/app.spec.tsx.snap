            <p>
              CatLord MC is a (mostly) vanilla minecraft server with an emphasis on community and trade. We have players with a wide variety of skills and interests who regularly come together to collaborate on amazing projects. We take pride in ensuring that our server is a safe haven from griefers and thiefs - though we very much encourage tasteful pranking!
            </p>
            <p>
              New players looking to join the server should contact one of our admins at ben@heidemann.co.uk or bernhard@heidemann.co.uk.

              World Info
            </h2>
            <p>
              The seed of the current CatLord world is 308809959. This seed has a large mooshroom island located at X=-10000 Z=10000. In order to allow construction of shops without fear of mob damage, we elected to set the world spawn to this location.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our world is periodically reset when we feel that we have played out the current world, however, backups are made and are available to download for nostalgias sake. There are currently no plans to reset the world in the near future, though it is likely there will be a hard reset when Mojang releases minecraft 1.17.

                   With this datapack the value of a particular food decreases with each time it is consumed. If the player eats a different food the value of the other food will increase again. Food which has not been eaten before by the player has a very significant effect.

                  </b>
                   Taking out some of the tedium of mining, this datapack means that if you mine an ore block all blocks of the same ore in the same vein (i.e. directly connected but not diagonally) will drop at the same time. Your pickaxe will wear just as much as if you had mined each block separately and any enchantment on your pickaxe will effect each of the blocks.

                   Each time an anvil is used to repair a tool the cost of this increases. With this datapack the cost of repairs remains the same. This datapack is probably more sensible during the earlier stage of the game and may be removed at a later stage.

                   This datapack alters the behaviour of vanilla Minecraft so that only one of the players present on the server has to sleep in order for night to move forward. Top tip, carry a bed or two.
